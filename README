This is just assorted stuff i have for having a more usable system on _my_ C201 w/ arch...
---

For keyboard: i have my .Xmodmap in this repo... note that i'm finnish with US keyboard C201s :P
TODO: Make it saner and more like ChromeOS ...


# For "okay" X11 perf:
pacman -R xf86-video-armsoc-rockchip
pacman -S xf86-video-fbturbo-git 


For sound:
i made a systemd service for running alsaucm so you hopefully dont burn your speakers...

# 3.14
if you want to run that, copy the ROCKCHIPI2S alsa ucm
data from ChromeOS and adjust alsaucm-setup.service accordingly (it's commented out there)

# 4.16
for working sound with pulseaudio: check my alsa ucm HiFi.conf in this repo
TODO: How does pavucontrol figure out the configuration names?
(you'll get "n/a" and "n/a (unplugged)" without a headset :P, figure it out from that lol..)


For blobby wifi: copy the brcm firmware incl. the .txt from ChromeOS, namely these files:
/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4354-sdio.bin 
/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4354-sdio.txt
(linux-firmware had a different bin and no .txt (that i guess was necessary), but i decided to trust ChromeOS instead...)
linux-firmware updates will likely walk over the bin though, ugh.
# chattr +i /lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4354-sdio.bin
Tada. Idk if that'll work but maybe :P



Kernel: the arch linux-armv7-chromebook will work, but...
lets just say, it's not the best because it's way too generic (loading rockchip-drm as a module? really...).
I reconfigured the arch kernel so i'm keeping that in linux-c201 here...
TODO: How to (semi-)automate keeping the kernel updated?
