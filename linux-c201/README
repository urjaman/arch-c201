My added patches are now in the git (github.com/urjaman/linux branch c201-${pkgver}_vN),
the multipatch file here is generated from that repo on an as-needed basis.

I try to keep some bootable binary package (just so you can bootstrap a system if needed) of this
kernel at: https://urja.dev/linux-c201/ -- No promises on availability tho.
