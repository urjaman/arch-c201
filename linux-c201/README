My added patches are now in the git (github.com/urjaman/linux branch c201-${pkgver})
since I had enough of dealing with patch files, and also since using that it's
easier to "sync" with the testing package.

I try to keep some bootable binary package (just so you can bootstrap a system if needed) of this
kernel at: https://urja.dev/linux-c201/ -- No promises on availability tho.
